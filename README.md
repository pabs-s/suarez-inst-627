***## INST627: Final Project -- Gender Wage Gap***

Welcome to Pablo Suarez's repository for his final project on the gender wage gap in INST627: Data Analytics for Information Professionals.

Upon opening the markdown file containing the code, please load in the libraries and packages I used to conduct my analysis. If you have not downloaded specific packages, please use this code and replace the x's with your desired package: install.packages('xxx').

There are several datasets employed throughout this project. The original files, and some modified files, can be found in my Google Drive (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bO2TePLiAQB5cuLW8-F3CyHYJkGIAV8v?usp=sharing). The data, code and files featured in the markdown file are also stored in my class repository on GitHub (https://github.com/pabs-s/suarez-inst-627). Within my markdown file, there are also Datawrapper links that can be entered in a browser to access each individual visualization. These visualization examples are included as figures within my final report as well. The final report (and the works cited page embedded within the report) are housed within my repository for ease of project submission on UMD ELMS. If an alternative submission method is needed, I'm happy to oblige.

As for the markdown file, all of the codeblocks can be run in order, with the exception of the codeblock on line 276-283. This specific codeblock uses a dataset created in the following section. There is a comment at the top of this specific codeblock with a reminder not to run it until the other section can call in the dataset it uses. Otherwise, you should be able to run everything in order. 

Thanks so much for taking the time to review my project and please take care!
